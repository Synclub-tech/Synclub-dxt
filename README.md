- **Base Style Selection**: Choose from five base styles (Korean manhwa, game, illustration, anime, manga) via user input.

### üìñ Step 3 - Text Storyboard Creation

- **Description**:
  Based on the finalized script (Step 1) and character information (Step 2), this step generates detailed text storyboards for 4 to 15 chapters. Each storyboard includes scene descriptions, character dialogues, and narration.
  If any parts of the storyboard are unsatisfactory, you can fine-tune them through natural language instructions.
- **Prompt Input Tips**:

  - **No Character Scene**
    Focus on describing the setting: environment, weather, time of day, atmosphere, etc.
  - **Single Character Scene**
    Describe the character's actions, facial expressions, surroundings, camera movement, and angles.
  - **Dual Character Scene**
    Describe both characters' actions, interactions, setting, camera movement, and perspective.
- **Output Example**:

  - **Chapter 1: The Promise of Cherry Blossoms**
  - **Description**: A classroom bathed in the warmth of spring. Cherry blossom petals flutter outside the window.
  - **Dialogue**:
    - **Yota Sato**: "Hey, Takahashi-san, want to walk home together after school?"
    - **Misaki Takahashi**: "I have studying to do."
  - **Narration**: A fleeting glance at her fingertips.

### üñºÔ∏è Step 4 - Comic Image Generation

* **Description**:
  Based on the character information from Step 2 and the text storyboards from Step 3, this step generates multiple comic-style images according to the number of chapters.
  If needed, the generated images can be further refined using natural language instructions.
* **Supported Edits**:
  You can make detailed adjustments to elements such as colors, hairstyles, facial expressions, and more.
  Simply describe what you want to change. For example:

  * "Change hair color to brown"
  * "Make the shirt white"
